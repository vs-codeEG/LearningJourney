#LearningJourney
JetBrains Academy Projects Repo 

This is a Hangman Project, part of learning journey in JetBrains Python Developer Stream. 

Note: 8/8 stage of Hangman Project example does not align with its unit test, which can cause you not to pass the project

Hint: You don't have to make the game so it will allow the user to play the game again once they finish the first round. 

The code share here works for passing the project, the writing of this is as at 2021.01.21
